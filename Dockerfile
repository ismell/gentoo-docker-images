# Update the base image
#
# The portage snapshot image is updated daily, while the base image
# is updated occasionally. We want to make sure we are always up to date.
#
# Other distros require the build cache to be manually invalidated to perform
# a system update. i.e., apt update. The reason being that the build cache can
# only hash the inputs. It doesn't realize that `apt update` performed an HTTP
# request to an external server, so it thinks it can reuse the same layer.
# Genoo doesn't suffer from this limitation. Since the portage database is
# provided as an image the build cache is properly invalidated when the portage
# database is updated.
# 
# In order to avoid rebuilding the same packages everytime there is a portage
# update, we generate bin packages and reuse the bin packages when regenerating
# the layer. It's questionable if using a bin package cache here is aceptable.
# The binpkgs don't take into account the CFLAGS, so the binpkgs won't be
# rebuilt when make.conf changes. If a rebuild is required, the bin package
# cache can be wiped.
#
# Additionally the distfiles are cached to avoid constantly downloading the
# package source on every rebuild. This is safe since each tarball is versioned
# and `should` never change.

# Portage packages define build time and runtime dependencies. We don't want
# any of the build time dependencies in the final image. So we split the image
# creation into two steps.
# 1) emerge the app and generate bin packages for all dependencies. This has
#    the advantage that we can also reuse the bin packages when regenerating
#    this layer.
# 2) emerge the app using only bin packages. This allows us to drop all the
#    build time dependencies and only install the runtime dependencies.
# 
# TODO: It would be nice to generate the final image with only the runtime
# deps requires to run the app. i.e., emerge --destination /image <package>
# Then we don't need the gentoo base package at all at runtime, but this
# requires packages to migrate to EAPI 7 and correctly define their BDEPENDs.
